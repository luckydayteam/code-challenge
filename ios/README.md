# Lucky Day Trivia Game Challenge

## Description 

A simple iOS trivia game to fetch True/False trivia questions from Open Trivia DB and display such that user can play one after another. 

## Goals

This challenge is designed to test your skills with:

* Swift / Objective C
* iOS SDK
* Object-Oriented Design 
* Consuming RESTful APIs
* iOS Data Storage
* Git

This challenge generally takes candidates no more than 3-4 hours to complete.

## Requirements

1. Setup a public GitHub repository 'code-challenge' to host the code.
2. In Xcode, create a new Xcode project:
   - Consume the [Open Trivia DB](https://opentdb.com/api.php?amount=20&type=boolean) to display True/False trivia questions for user to answer 
   - Create a basic landing page & user should be able to see the first True/False trivia question. 
   - Upon answering a trivia question, user should see the result of their answer as correct or incorrect, and should swipe automatically to answer next question. 
   - User should be able to swipe back to see all answered questions. 
   - Make the UI spiffy.

### Bonus Points

* Paginate to load the next set of questions by invoking the same [Open Trivia DB API](https://opentdb.com/api.php?amount=10&type=boolean) above.
* Writing local unit tests (big plus).
* Anything else cool that you can think of.

## Submission Guidelines

1. Setup a public GitHub repository 'code-challenge' to host the code.
2. Create a README file within the repository that contains the following:
   - Brief walkthrough of app design / choices made
   - Briefly explain your object oriented analysis and design
   - Local environment setup instructions to compile and run the app
   - Test suite setup/execution instructions (if applicable) 
3. Email links to your **public GitHub** repo with your name in subject line to [dev-challenge@luckydayapp.com](mailto:dev-challenge@luckydayapp.com)
