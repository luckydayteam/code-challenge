# Lucky Day Android Photo Search Challenge

## Description 

A simple Android app to fetch popular images from Flickr and display them.

## Goals

This challenge is designed to test your skills with:

* Java
* Android SDK
* Object-Oriented Design 
* Consuming RESTful APIs
* Git

This challenge generally takes candidates no more than 3 hours to complete.

## Requirements

1. Setup a public GitHub repository to host the code.
2. In Android Studio, create a new project:
   - Consume the [Flickr Public Feed](https://www.flickr.com/services/feeds/docs/photos_public/) to display the title, image, & published date of the public photos for any given Flickr search keywords or phrase.
   - Create a basic landing page with search bar at the top. User should be able to search for any keywords or phrase, and on new search, the screen should recycle to show new search results.  
   - Make the UI spiffy.

### Bonus Points

* Writing local unit tests (big plus).
* Paginate the search results when user scrolls down
* Anything else cool that you can think of.

## Submission Guidelines

1. Setup a public GitHub repository 'code-challenge' to host the code.
2. Create a README file within the repository that contains the following:
   - Brief walkthrough of app design / choices made
   - Briefly explain your object oriented analysis and design
   - Local environment setup instructions to compile and run the app
   - Test suite setup/execution instructions (if applicable) 
3. Email links to your **public GitHub** repo with your name in subject line to [dev-challenge@luckydayapp.com](mailto:dev-challenge@luckydayapp.com)
