# Lucky Day Backend Photo Search Challenge

## Description 

Build a simple API to fetch popular images from Flickr and display them.

## Goals

This challenge is designed to test your skills with:

* C#
* Building API
* Object-Oriented Design 
* Consuming RESTful APIs
* Git

This challenge generally takes candidates no more than 3 hours to complete.

## Requirements

1. Setup a public GitHub repository 'code-challenge' to host the code.
2. In Visual Studio, create a new project:
   - Consume the [Flickr Public Feed](https://www.flickr.com/services/feeds/docs/photos_public/) to display the title, image, & published date of the public photos for any given Flickr search keywords or phrase.
   - Create an API that accepts a parameter 'q' with the search string. User should be able to search for any keywords or phrase, and on new search, the API should return new search results.  
   - Make the API response JSON however format you prefer.

### Bonus Points

* Writing local unit tests (big plus).
* Build an API Pagination to pass page and limit. 
* Anything else cool that you can think of.

## Submission Guidelines

1. Setup a public GitHub repository 'code-challenge' to host the code.
2. Create a README file within the repository that contains the following:
   - Brief walkthrough of app design / choices made
